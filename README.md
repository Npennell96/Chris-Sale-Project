# Chris-Sale-Project
A data exploration and visualization I did on Chris Sale in 2019 as part of my Masters of Data Science

The Project is broken into two parts, the exploration section and the Visualisation portion.

### Exploration
In this section, the goal was to find and explore an open source of data and find and explain the story the data is telling. Below links to the report and the code hosted on RPubs.

### Visualisation
In the visualization section, the task was to use this report and story to come up with a visualization that could show the story and aid in the explanation.
